# Strategic Patient Risk Stratification & Readmission Predictive Modeling

## 📊 Project Overview
This project addresses a critical healthcare challenge: reducing 30-day hospital readmissions for diabetic patients at Vitality Health Network (VHN). By leveraging data science techniques, we developed a predictive model to identify high-risk patients and provide actionable insights for healthcare providers.

## 🏥 Business Context
VHN faces significant financial penalties under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) due to their 18% readmission rate for diabetic patients, which exceeds national benchmarks. Our analysis aims to transform raw clinical data into strategic insights that can improve patient outcomes and reduce operational costs.

## 📈 Project Objectives
- Identify primary drivers of diabetic patient readmissions
- Develop a risk stratification framework (Vitality Complexity Index)
- Analyze medication efficacy and treatment protocols
- Investigate demographic disparities in readmission rates
- Provide data-driven recommendations for care management

## 🔄 Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Clinical Sanitation
**Objective:** "My data is clean, realistic, and ready for analysis."
- Loaded and assessed clinical data using Pandas
- Standardized missing values (converted "?" to NaN)
- Filtered out deceased patients (discharge_disposition_id 11, 19, 20)
- Removed invalid columns (e.g., weight column with >90% missingness)
- Ensured proper data type conversions

### 🔍 Phase 2: Data Enrichment via Web Scraping
**Objective:** "Turn medical codes into real disease names"
- **Step 1:** Identified top 20 diagnosis codes from `diag_1`
- **Step 2:** Implemented web scraping using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
  - Target: ICD-9 coding repository (icd9.chrisendres.com)
  - Added `time.sleep(1)` for ethical scraping
- **Step 3:** Created new column `Primary_Diagnosis_Desc`
  - Example: `diag_1 = 428` → `Primary_Diagnosis_Desc = "Heart Failure"`

### 📊 Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Objective:** "Ask questions and answer them with charts"
**Questions Answered:**
- Who gets readmitted more? (Age, Gender, Race analysis)
- Do insulin patients have higher readmission rates?
- Do emergency admissions increase risk?
- Does longer hospital stay correlate with readmission?
- What discharge dispositions have highest return rates?

**Tools Used:**
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations
- Groupby operations with percentage calculations
- Statistical analysis of correlations

**📌 Important Note:** `<30` readmissions are a small minority group (~10-15%), so we focus on percentages rather than raw counts.

### ⭐ Phase 4: Vitality Complexity Index (VCI)
**Objective:** "Create a simple risk score for patients"
**LACE Scoring System:**

| Component | Meaning | Scoring Logic |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **L** | Length of Stay | `time_in_hospital < 1 day: 0 points`<br>`1–4 days: 1 point`<br>`5–13 days: 4 points`<br>`≥14 days: 7 points` |
| **A** | Emergency Admission | `Emergency/Trauma admission: 3 points`<br>`Other admissions: 0 points` |
| **C** | Comorbidity Burden | `number_diagnoses < 4: 0 points`<br>`4–7 diagnoses: 3 points`<br>`≥8 diagnoses: 5 points` |
| **E** | Emergency Visit History | `0 visits: 0 points`<br>`1–4 visits: 3 points`<br>`>4 visits: 5 points` |

**Formula:** `VCI_Score = L + A + C + E`

**Risk Stratification:**
- **Low Risk:** VCI < 7
- **Medium Risk:** VCI 7–10
- **High Risk:** VCI > 10

**Validation:** Compared actual readmission rates across risk groups to validate scoring logic.

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

### Readmission Drivers
- **Clinical Factors**: Number of diagnoses, emergency visits, length of stay
- **Operational Factors**: Discharge disposition, admission type
- **Medication Factors**: Insulin therapy vs oral medications
- **Demographic Factors**: Age, race, and gender disparities

### Risk Stratification Results
The Vitality Complexity Index successfully identified high-risk patients with significantly higher readmission rates:
- **Low Risk (VCI < 7)**: Readmission rate of 8%
- **Medium Risk (VCI 7-10)**: Readmission rate of 15%
- **High Risk (VCI > 10)**: Readmission rate of 24%

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Implement mandatory follow-up protocols for patients with VCI scores >10
2. **Medication Management**: Review insulin therapy protocols for high-risk patients
3. **Discharge Planning**: Enhance transition care for patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities
4. **Resource Allocation**: Focus nursing resources on emergency admission patients
5. **Equity Initiatives**: Address demographic disparities in readmission rates

## 🎯 Business Impact
- **Financial**: Potential reduction in HRRP penalties through targeted interventions
- **Operational**: Improved resource allocation and care coordination
- **Clinical**: Enhanced patient outcomes through proactive risk management
- **Strategic**: Data-driven decision making for healthcare leadership
